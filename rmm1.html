Introduction to Databases

A Database is an organized collection of data.

There are many types of databases with organizing the data in a different way to solve different problems.

Relational Database
Graph Database
Document Database
Key-Value Database
and many more ...

# DBMS
Softwares are used to ease the access, create and updation of data in the database. These softwares are called Database Management Systems(DBMS)

# Relational Databases
In Relational database, data is organized in one or more tables. A table in relational database looks as below

Relational Table

# Table
# Row
A single row in a table is called a tuple or record

A row in a table represents a set of related data i.e In our example student id(SID), name(SName), age(SAge), class(SClass) & section(SSection) are different information related to a student.

# Attribute:
Each row in table can be broken down into several smaller parts of data known as attributes In our example, the table consists of four attributes: SID, SName, SAge, SClass, SSection

# Primary Key
A primary key is a column(s) which uniquely identifies a row

# Structured Query Language(SQL)
Structured Query Language(SQL) is a database query language used to perform operations on data in Relational DBMS.

A request to RDBMS is generally referred as Query.

To query a Relational Database Management System inorder to retrieve, update, delete or create new data developers use SQL.

In the next tutorials you will learn more on how to query RDBMS using SQL.

Sqlite3 is a RDBMS, most commonly used in learning and development environments.

We will be using sqlite3 for all our learning purposes.
