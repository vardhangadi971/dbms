# GROUP BY
Till now you have learnt how to calculate aggregates on all the rows of a table or on a selected rows. In this reference you will learn how split a table in multiple groups and apply aggregation on each group.

# GROUP BY in SQL
The GROUP BY keyword in SQL is used to group rows which have same values for the mentioned attributes. You can perform aggregations on these groups to get finer analytics.

For example with group you can perform operations like

Calculating the average of student scores for each section for the below given model.
Student
    - student_id - integer
    - name - string
    - score - float
    - section - integer
# Points to remember
GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT statement.
If an SQL query has a WHERE clause, the GROUP BY clause is placed after the WHERE clause.
In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed before ORDER BY clause if used any.
GROUP BY returns only one result per group of data.
# Syntax
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(columnx) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column1, column2 ....;
Here aggregate_function is one of SUM , AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT.

# Examples
Get the maximum score of students for each age group.
SELECT AGE, MAX(SCORE) FROM Student GROUP BY AGE;
The above SQL query, segregates the rows in Student table into multiple groups, where each group has rows which have same value for age attribute and calculates max score for each group.

# Result
AGE|MAX(SCORE)
18|95
19|68
20|95
21|97
22|99
23|93
.......
Calculate the number of students having name starting with "a" for each age value in database.
SELECT AGE as student_age, COUNT(ID) as no_of_students FROM Student WHERE name LIKE "a%" Group BY AGE ORDER BY AGE; 
The above SQL query segregates the records with name starting with a into groups which have same age and calculates the number of such students in each group.

Result

22|6
23|5
24|6
25|8
26|2
27|1
....
Note: Above Example are explained by using the previous student database

# Having Clause
This is similar to WHERE clause but used to apply conditions on groups.

SELECT age, Count(id) 
FROM Student 
GROUP BY age
HAVING Count(id) > 5; 
The above SQL query, segregates the rows in Student table into multiple groups, where each group has rows which have same value for age attribute and calculates number of id attributes in each group. And the having clause selects only the groups which have count(id) greater than 5.

# Result
AGE|Count(id)
19|6
22|6
24|6
25|8
31|6
34|6
37|7
38|7
# Try it yourself
Write an SQL query to calculate average salary of employees for each age value in db, and your SQL query should return entries which have average salary greater than 9000.
