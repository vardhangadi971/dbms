Left Outer Join

A LEFT JOIN, also know as a LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the "left" table and matching rows from the "right" table. If there is no match for a row on the right table, null values are filled for the columns in the resulting imaginary table.

# Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, column3... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;
# Example
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Owner LEFT JOIN Car on Owner.owner_id==Car.owner_id;
# Result
owner_id	name	id	model_no	owner_id
1	RAM	1	Benz C Class	1
2	John	2	Benz D Class	2
3	Robert	3	Benz E Class	3
3	Robert	4	Benz F Class	3
3	Robert	5	Benz G Class	3
4	Mike	null	null	null
5	Jessie	null	null	null
As Mike and Jessie are not the owner of any car, we got null for right table attributes(i.e., Car in this example).

# Right Outer Join
Right Outer Join

A RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the "right" table and matching rows from the "left" table. If there is no match for a row on the left table, null values are filled for the columns in the resulting imaginary table.

# Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, column3... FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;
Note
Sqlite3 doesn't support Right Outer Join

# Full Outer Join
Full Outer Join

A FULL OUTER JOIN returns

all rows that match the condition &
rows of first table which don't have any corresponding entries in the second table &
rows of second table which don't have any corresponding entries in the first table.
# Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, column3... FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;
Note
Sqlite3 doesn't support FULL OUTER JOIN

# Natural Join
A natural join is a type of join that combines tables based on columns with the same name and type.

# Syntax
SELECT * FROM Table1 NATURAL JOIN Table2;
# Example
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Owner NATURAL JOIN Car;
# Result
owner_id	name	car_id	model_no
1	RAM	1	Benz C Class
2	John	2	Benz D Class
3	Robert	3	Benz E Class
3	Robert	4	Benz F Class
3	Robert	5	Benz G Class
The common field in our case is owner_id so SQL has stitched the entries in Owner and Car which have same value for owner_id attribute.

# Cross Join
InnerJoin
A CROSS JOIN, also know as a CARTESIAN JOIN returns all the records formed by stitching every record in the first table with every record in the second table.

# Syntax
SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
# Example
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Owner CROSS JOIN Car;
# Result
owner_id	name	id	model_no	owner_id
1	RAM	1	Benz C Class	1
1	RAM	2	Benz D Class	2
1	RAM	3	Benz E Class	3
1	RAM	4	Benz F Class	3
1	RAM	5	Benz G Class	3
1	RAM	6	BMW	
1	RAM	7	Ford	
2	John	1	Benz C Class	1
2	John	2	Benz D Class	2
2	John	3	Benz E Class	3
2	John	4	Benz F Class	3
2	John	5	Benz G Class	3
2	John	6	BMW	
2	John	7	Ford

You might have noticed that owner_id is repeated in the result as the two tables have owner_id column, the result has two owner_id columns one from each table.

# Try it yourself
Make use of the imdb database given to you and apply the above concepts to solve the below problems

# Task 1
Perform natural join between Movie and Cast

# Task 2
Perform a left outer join between Director and MovieDirectors.

# Task 3
Find the number of movies each actor has casted in

# Output Format:
names	movies_count
Antonio	3
...

# Task 4
Perform a left outer join between Actor and Cast and fine the actors haven't casted in any movie.
